    "### Key Facts About Obesity\n",
    "- Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975\n",
    "- In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese.\n",
    "- 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.\n",
    "- Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.\n",
    "- 41 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2016.\n",
    "- Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.\n",
    "- Obesity is preventable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obesity is increasingly affecting humans of all ages, shapes and sizes in the modern world. This notebook takes a look into some of the risk factors for obesity and the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland [1], and irishhealth.com [2], there are a number of classifications, based on Body Mass Index (BMI), ranging from Healthy to Class 3 Obese, as seen in the table below:"
